    - fullerene-conveyor-cart: A modified nanotube that can be bonded to others like it in a sequence. Has a knob that can be pressed along by the wheel of a NEMS conveyor, and two knobs carrying sample Mechanosynthethic tooltips.
    - grantry: a carbon nanotube that can be moved linearly by a fullerene rotor. Gear's teeth are implemented as protruding fullerene knobs.
